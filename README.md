# Artificial Neural Network for Customer’s Churn Prediction

Churn’s prediction could be a great asset in the business strategy for retention applying before the exit of customers and 
We will create a real model with python, applied on a bank environment. This model will tell us if the customer is going or not to exit
from the bank. Churn rate (sometimes called attrition rate), in its broadest sense, is a measure of the number of individuals or items 
moving out of a collective group over a specific period.

What are neural networks?
Neural networks, commonly known as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are quite a simulation of human brain functionality in machine 
learning (ML) problems. ANNs shall be noted not as a solution for all the problems that arise, but would provide better results with many 
other techniques altogether for various ML tasks. Most common use of ANNs are clustering and classification, which can be used for 
regression tasks as well.

So, In our dataset we would be dealing with Churn Modeling i.e. we would be writing a Artificial Neural Network to find out reasons as to
why and which customers are actually leaving the bank and their dependencies on one another. This is a classification problem 0-1 
classification(1 if customer Leaves and 0 if customer stays).
